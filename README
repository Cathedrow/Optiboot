Optiboot is an optimised bootloader for Arduino.

It implements the STK500 upload protocol, so application code can be flashed
over a serial port using Avrdude or the Arduino IDE.

Optiboot is very small (512 bytes) and has lots of optimisations to speed up
the flashing workflow including Erase-while-communicating, high baud rates
(115200 baud) and prompt bootloader exits.
